# CPP Project Summer 2019
 Random access inventory vector
 
 Required to have 3 functions
  - Must have an add option in which the user can add and inventory item
  - Must have a delete option which specifically deletes the first object in the vector
  - Must have an exit option
  
  I added the view inventory option in 2020 because I felt it was missing something to display the current inventory
